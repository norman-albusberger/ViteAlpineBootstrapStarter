## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 12.x or later

### Installation

To set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/norman-albusberger/vite-alpine-bootstrap-boilerplate.git`

2. Navigate to the directory:
   `cd vite-alpine-bootstrap-boilerplate`

3. Install the dependencies:
   `npm install`

4. Launch the development server:
   `npm run dev`

Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

### Component Autoloading

The boilerplate comes with an autoloading feature for components, simplifying your workflow. Create a new file in the `components` directory, and the system will automatically load it into your application.

#### How it Works

- Components are dynamically imported based on naming conventions, eliminating the need for explicit import statements.
- New components are auto-initialized upon creation, streamlining the development process.

#### Benefits

- Rapid component creation and ease of management.
- A maintainable and scalable codebase without manual configuration.

### Development Scripts

#### `npm run dev`
Starts the Vite development server with hot module replacement. Ideal for active development.

#### `npm run build`
Compiles the app for production to the `dist` folder.

#### `npm run preview`
Serves the production build locally for previewing before deployment.

### Best Practices with JetBrains IDEs

Optimize your development with features from JetBrains IDEs like PhpStorm/WebStorm:

- **Vite Integration**: Use the latest IDE version for optimal Vite support.
- **NPM Scripts Tool Window**: Run and manage scripts directly from the IDE.
- **Version Control**: Benefit from the IDE's robust version control features.

## SCSS Structure

The boilerplate's SCSS structure is organized as follows:

- `main.scss`: The entry point for all styles.
- `base/`: Holds the foundational styles, such as resets and typography.
-

 `components/`: Styles for individual components.
- `utilities/`: Utility classes and mixins.

Maintain a clean and modular SCSS structure by following these guidelines.

## Environment Variables

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file at the root of your project.
2. Add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of `NAME=VALUE`.

### Accessing Variables in Code

Use `import.meta.env.VITE_YOUR_VARIABLE` to access your environment variables in your application code.

### Best Practices

- Keep sensitive information out of version control.
- Use different environment variables for development, staging, and production.

### Adding Environment Variables to `.gitignore`

Add `.env*` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information from being tracked by Git.

### Loading Environment Variables for Production

For production builds, set environment variables through your hosting provider or CI/CD pipeline.
